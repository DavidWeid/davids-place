totalTime: 80 minutes

ingredients:
  - category: Dough
    items:
      - 2 to 2⅓ cups all-purpose flour
      - 1 packet (2¼ teaspoon) instant yeast
      - 1½ teaspoon sugar
      - ¾ teaspoon salt
      - ¼ teaspoon garlic powder and dried basil
      - 2 tablespoon olive oil
      - ¾ cup warm water

instructions:
  - In a large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, yeast, sugar, salt, garlic powder, and basil
  - Add oil and warm water to the flour mixture and mix well
  - Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. The dough should be slightly sticky, but manageable
  - Generously oil a large bowl on all sides and place the dough in the bowl, turning to coat the dough
  - Cover the bowl tightly and place in a warm area to rise for at least 30 minutes or until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 425°F
  - Punch down the dough and roll out to desired thickness on a lightly floured surface. Place on a greased pizza pan, form a crust, and poke holes thoughout the dough surface
  - Add desired toppings and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly

## Notes

- Make sure the water for the yeast is warm, not hot. If the water is too hot, it will kill the yeast and the dough will not rise. If the water is too cold, the yeast will not activate and the dough will not rise. The water should be between 105°F and 115°F.

- This dough can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Allow the dough to proof in the refrigerator, and ensure it is tightly covered and oiled to avoid drying out. Just let the dough come to room temperature before rolling out and baking. This will give the dough a more complex flavor.
