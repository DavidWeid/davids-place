totalTime: 30 minutes

ingredients:
  - category: General
    items:
      - 1 pound green beans, trimmed and halved
      - salt and pepper to taste
      - 1½ cups crispy fried onions, divided

  - category: Sauce
    items:
      - 2 tablespoons butter
      - 1 shallot, minced
      - 2 garlic cloves, minced
      - 1 cup finely chopped mushrooms (button, baby bella, or cremini)
      - 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
      - ¾ cup vegetable broth
      - 1 cup alternative milk (unsweetened)

instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt well. Add green beans and cook for 5 minutes, then drain and place in an ice water bath. Drain and set aside
  - Meanwhile, start preparing sauce. In a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat, add vegan butter, shallots, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper and stir. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then add mushrooms and season with a bit more salt and pepper. Cook for 3-4 minutes more or until lightly browned
  - Sprinkle in flour and whisk to stir and coat the vegetables. Cook for 1 minute, then slowly add in vegetable stock, whisking to incorporate
  - Add milk next and whisk to stir again. Season with a touch more salt and pepper and bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low to thicken. Cook for 5-7 minutes more, or until thick and bubbly. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed
  - Remove from heat and add ⅓ of the fried onions and all of the cooked green beans. Toss to coat well, and top with remaining fried onions
  - Bake for 15 minutes, or until warmed through and bubbly and slightly browned on top. Serve
