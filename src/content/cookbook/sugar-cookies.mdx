prepTime: 45 minutes
cookTime: 7 minutes
totalTime: 52 minutes
ingredients:
  - category: Dough
    items:
      - 1/3 cup granulated sugar
      - 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
      - 1 egg
      - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
      - 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
      - 1/8 teaspoon salt
      - 1/2 teaspoon baking powder + another 1/8 teaspoon

instructions:
  - Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, cream the sugar and butter together until light and fluffy, about 5-10 minutes.
  - Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until well combined.
  - Add 1 cup of the flour, salt, and baking powder and turn on low. Add the remaining flour and mix until no longer crumbly and starts to stick together.
  - Wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
  - After dough is chilled, lightly flour a silicone mat and place dough on top, coating the underside lightly with the flour.
  - Place the same plastic wrap on top of the dough and roll it out to either 3/8" thick for thicker, chewier cookies or 1/4" thick for thinner, crispier cookies.
  - Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes and place on the prepared baking sheet.
  - Bake for 7 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake for 1-2 minutes more, or until the edges are just starting to turn golden brown.
  - Cool on a cooling rack.
