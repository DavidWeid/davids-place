totalTime: 30 minutes

ingredients:
  - category: General
    items:
      - 3 pounds Yukon Gold or russet potatoes
      - 1 cup broth of choice
      - ⅓ cup mayonnaise
      - ¾ teaspoon dried parsley
      - ¼ teaspoon pepper
      - salt to taste

instructions:
  - Peel and cut the potatoes and add them to a 4- or 5- quart steel pot. Cover with 1 inch of water and bring to a boil
  - Reduce heat to maintain a steady rolling boil. Cook until potatoes are fork-tender (approximately 10-15 minutes). Be careful not to overcook or the potatoes will become too starchy
  - Drain potatoes in a colander and then return them to the pot
  - Add broth and mix using an electric hand mixer until the ingredients are well combined and lumps are removed. Be sure not to overmix or the consistency of the potatoes will become too gluey. Alternatively, you can use a potato masher, if preferred
  - Stir in mayo, parsley, salt and pepper
